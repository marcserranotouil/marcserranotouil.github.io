Project analysis of my Curriculum Vitae:



Target User Profile

My curriculum vitae is addressed to the Human Resources professionals and managers of a company (for example, Google, that handles large amounts of curriculum vitae and has little time for reviewing them). They select by elimination and are sensitive to first impressions. They need to quickly determine what they know and what they can bring to the company. With just a glance, assess whether or not the candidate corresponds to the profile they are looking for. It's important not to make any serious mistakes that rule out your candidacy and I had to make a CV adapted to the position offered and the organization to which I'm directed.



The Human Resource professional is expected to find my personal and contact information from my name and surnames, my mobile phone number and my personal email. My profile photo will be found because the first impression is very important and it's a point in favor when it comes to being chosen. It's also expected to find information about my education, the type of certified education obtained in their respective years and educational centers. And the degree in computer engineering that I'm studying. Also is expected to find the level of the languages I have been studying.  



The final user is expected to find information that I am looking for work and that I am motivated, and always with a good attitude to be able to work in the company in which my skills will help the company achieve its goal. Finally, the company will be able to know the work experience that I have (I don't have experience so I put the typical text about lorem ipsum that represents my work experience ), this is a good a point if it's adapted to the position offered.




Information Architecture
 
My project is a single page project. My CV consists of two principal parts: the left_side part and the right_side part. The left_side part is composed of three lists: one list with my personal information, another list with my formative education and another with the level of language of different languages. On the top of these lists, there's my image with my name and surnames.



The right_side part is composed by profile, skills and experience. The profile and experience parts are texts and the skill's part is composed of a list of skills.




Visual Design


The page layout is a vertical curriculum vitae with a design that attracts attention.



The typography used are Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif. I have chosen this typography because it's a formal typography and a sharp typeface, so it's perfect to be the pillar on which the text rests.In the wallpaper I have used a softer bluish. The composition of the color in terms of the intensity of the primary colors is rgb(173,216,230) named lightblue.



The box container of my curriculum vitae has a shadow effect to highlight it more. The left_side part of the CV is colored with a darker blue with rgb(1,40,167). 

If the cursor is hovered over the image, an effect is applied that enlarges the image and the cursor also switches to a pointer. There's a solid separation line colored rgba(255,255,255,0.2) to separate the image and name from the information. If the cursor is hovering over the titles contact, education and languages title, the cursor switches to pointer and the hover color of the titles turns  blue rgb(0,97,224), a blue lighter than the blue on the left side and stronger than that of the background to differentiate the different shades of blue. Also, if it's the cursor on the part of contact information it will change as a pointer.

The list of contacts has visual icons of Whatsapp, email, linkedin and location that represent my mobile phone number, my email, my linkedin account and my location. The list of education has different types of height to distinguish between the year of beginning and end of studies, the type of educative formation and the educational institution. The years are colored with a blue lighter named aqua with rgb(0,255,255). The other is colored with an aliceblue color with rgb(240,248,255).

The list of languages is composed of the languages that I have learnt. The representation of the level of the languages. I have used  two lines to create an effect and represent the level with it. There's a black line at the background of the other that's it's coloured with the same aqua color explained before. I have the highest level in Catalan and Spanish, so it's for this reason that the line is 100% aqua color. With an English level more than normal I have represented with a 75% covered aqua color over the black line. Finally, my French level is normal, so I have represented a 50% colored line with aqua color.The background color of the right_side is aliceblue with rgb(240,248,255). On this right part I have title texts colored rgb(17,134,236) to contrast with the white background. Then, the list of skills is composed by skills that I have with colored icons that represent all of them.

Finally, there's a text about my experience of working.
